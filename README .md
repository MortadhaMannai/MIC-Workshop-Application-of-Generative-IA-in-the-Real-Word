## Welcome to the Repository

Welcome to the NMTC-2023-LLM-Workshop repository! Here, you'll find comprehensive resources, code, and instructions for exploring and building AI-powered chatbots using cutting-edge language models. This repository aims to provide a hands-on learning experience in working with different frameworks and APIs to understand the capabilities of language models.

Feel free to navigate the repository, contribute, and explore the various projects included. Your engagement and contributions are valued and encouraged.

## Introduction to Language Models (LLMs)

This workshop, authored by Manai Mortadha, serves as an entry point to Language Models (LLMs), powerful AI constructs designed to comprehend, generate, and manipulate human language. Language models like PaLM, Hugging Face, and OpenAI have significantly impacted natural language processing tasks, enabling applications such as chatbots, language translation, text generation, and more.


## Workshop Projects

### Chat-Bot using Streamlit and OpenAI

One project involves crafting a chatbot interface using Streamlit, a user-friendly Python framework for web applications. This chatbot harnesses OpenAI's API to generate responses, providing an interactive platform for communication.

### Chatbot using Hugging Face and Streamlit

Another project focuses on developing a chatbot using Hugging Face's Transformers library integrated with Streamlit. Hugging Face provides access to various pre-trained language models, and through Streamlit, an interactive chat interface is created to interact with these models, showcasing their capabilities.

### Chatbot using PaLM

Within this workshop, participants will delve into the creation of a chatbot utilizing the PaLM (Probabilistic and Logical Models) API. PaLM, developed by Google, offers advanced generative AI capabilities, empowering the creation of conversational agents that mimic human-like responses.
