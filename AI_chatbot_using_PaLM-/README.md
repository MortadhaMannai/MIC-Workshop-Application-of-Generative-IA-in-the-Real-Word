# AI Chatbot using PaLM API

This project is an AI chatbot built using Google's PaLM (Probabilistic and Logical Models) API key. PaLM provides powerful generative AI capabilities that allow the chatbot to generate human-like responses based on the input it receives.

## Installation

Before running the chatbot, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You'll also need to install the required Python libraries. Use the following command to install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure to obtain an API key for PaLM from Google and place it in a file named `.env`. The `.env` file should contain your PaLM API key in the following format:

```
PALM_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Usage

To start the AI chatbot, run the following command:

```bash
python chatbot.py
```

The chatbot will prompt you for input, and based on the PaLM AI model, it will generate responses to engage in a conversation.
